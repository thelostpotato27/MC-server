# Minecraft server hosted on AWS

Hey, this is a minecraft server that I will be working on for friends to play on/practice AWS. The eventual goal is for the server to deploy programatically, auto-scale, be modded, and have a landing page that summarizes the things that have happened in the server. I'll be updating this README as time goes on.
